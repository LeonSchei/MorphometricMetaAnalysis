* BIA - Bedform Identification Algorithm *
******************************************
* ****** Version 1.0 ** Year 2023 ****** *
******************************************
* This Matlab function analyzes two-     *
* dimensional bed elevation profiles     *
* provided as input vectors lx and lz.   *
* It outputs a struct variable Dune that *
* comprises the location of identified   *
* dune crests and troughs on these       *
* vectors as well as the corresponding   *
* morphometric characteristics, such as  *
* dune height, length, asymmetry and     *
* water depth. To assess a 3D bathymetry *
* the function should be used in a loop. *
